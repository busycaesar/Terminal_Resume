# Terminal Resume

## Description

This repository hosts my unique terminal-based resumes. Instead of a traditional PDF or web-based format, my resume is designed to be accessed directly from the command line. This approach offers a minimalist and convenient way to share my resume, especially for developers and tech-savvy individuals who are comfortable with command-line tools.
